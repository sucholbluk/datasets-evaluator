# Datasets Evaluator
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system for evaluating the quality of research datasets in terms of compliance with: [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [5\*](https://5stardata.info/en/) principles.
The Project will consist of:
- Compliance Evaluation System
- Web Service
The system will operate on datasets in repositories that:
- are listed in [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) registry
- provide [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/)
## Current Status
The project is in its initial stages of development. (I've started to work on it just recently)
